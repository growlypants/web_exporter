#Web Exporter

##Goal
The goal of this project is to transform any web app into a static set of files.

##Inspirateion
I get asked a lot to make weenie websites for my friends. However I hate HTML and css. I don't want to have to copy the navigation divs in every document. I want to write HAML and SASS. I want to use partials and helpers. This allows you to write your application in any language, and it will export a static set of html, js, css, image files. All of the urls are relatively linked so they can view it on a file system and then upload it to a nifty ftp server somewhere.

#Usage
I haven't figured out how I want peeps to use this yet.
